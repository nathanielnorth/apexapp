# Apex: About

Hi! I'm Nat.

Apex is the app I always wanted but could never find.

I run a small service based business with clients scheduled via my iPhone calendar. Many client bookings are made months in advance, I found I was spending a lot of time writing texts and emails to remind clients of their booking and often looking up their Contact if I was running early or late for their appointment or finding directions to their location.

Apex solves these issues and reduces so much time by matching Contacts with calendar appointments. You can also build a template so with just a tap you can text or email a client reminding them of the appointment date and time and personalise the message using their name and other details.

I hope you find Apex useful too ðŸ˜Ž

(Thanks to Ash my UI engineer for the helpful comments and opinions along the way.)
