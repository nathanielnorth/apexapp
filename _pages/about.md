# Apex: About

Hi! I'm Nat 👋🏼

Thanks for checking out Apex!

Apex is the app I always wanted but could never find.

In my day job I book clients in my iPhone calendar app. I realised I was constantly looking up a Contact to remind them of the upcoming appointment, or call them if I was running late, or get directions to their location. I'd always wanted a calendar app which would match a Contact with the calendar appointment and give me options from there.

I started building Apex in May 2020 as the pandemic hit and I had more spare time. I'd never released an app before and had virtually no idea about writing iOS code. Since then Apex has slowly developed from a very rough proof of concept demo app to a simple calendar app with some unique features.

I hope you find Apex usefull too 😀
