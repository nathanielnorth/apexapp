# Apex: About

Hi! I'm Nat 👋🏼

Thanks for checking out Apex.

Apex is the app I always wanted but could never find.

To stay organised in my day job I book clients in my iPhone calendar. I realised I was constantly looking up a Contact to remind them of the upcoming appointment, or call them if I was running late, or getting directions to their location. I'd always wanted a calendar app which would match Contacts with a calendar appointment or recognise phone numbers and email addresses which could build simple text messages for me and give me options from there.

With an interest in programming but little experience writing iOS code, I started building Apex in May 2020. Since then Apex has slowly developed from a very rough proof of concept demo app on just my iPhone to a simple calendar app with some unique features.

Comments and suggestions are welcome but please remember I'm a single developer not a corporation and all received emails run through a mindness filter. If the email is unkind, it gets deleted.

I hope you find Apex usefull too!

Nat 😎
